# Email-Automation
Application that automates response to emails using OpenAI and Google's APIs.
The Python code labeled "Backend.py" does two things:
1. Automatically responds to emails that are identified as "small talk", such as "Hi! It's nice to meet you!"
2. Schedules a meeting with those who want to have a personal conversation with the user. Meetings are scheduled based on the user's availability as indicated by their Google Calendar.

Note: This application relies on settings specified by a .env file that was not included here for security purposes.
