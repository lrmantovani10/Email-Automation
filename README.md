# Email-Automation
Application that automates response to emails using OpenAI and Google's APIs.
The Python code labeled "Backend.py" does two things:
1. Automatically responds to emails that are identified as "small talk", such as "Hi! It's nice to meet you!"
2. Schedules a meeting with those who want to have a personal conversation with the user. Meetings are scheduled based on the user's availability as indicated by their Google Calendar.

Workflow:
* Once users log in with their Gmail credentials, the application will read through unread emails on their inbox and label them into two broad categories: "followup" and "small talk".
  * Followup emails will be automatically responded with a calendar link to a meeting in a time convenient for the receiver of the email.
  * "small talk" questions will be responded with a shorter and more conversational tone, as generated by OpenAI's GPT-4 model. This is meant for busy executives / managers who don't have time to respond to their emails to sound friendly :)

Note: This application relies on settings specified by a .env file that was not included here for security purposes.
