# Email-Automation
An application that automates response to emails using OpenAI and Google's APIs. The Python code labeled "Backend.py" does two things:
1. Automatically responds to emails that are identified as "small talk", such as "Hi! It's nice to meet you!"
2. Schedules a meeting with those who want to have a personal conversation with the user. Meetings are scheduled based on the user's availability as indicated by their Google Calendar.
   
Workflow:
* Once users log in with their Gmail credentials, the application will read through unread emails in their inbox and label them into two broad categories: "follow-up" and "small talk".
   * Follow-up emails will be automatically responded to with a calendar link to a meeting at a time convenient for the receiver of the email.
   * "small talk" questions will be responded to with a shorter and more conversational tone, as generated by OpenAI's GPT-4 model. This is meant for busy executives/managers who don't have time to respond to their emails to sound friendly :)

Note: This application relies on settings specified by a .env file that was not included here for security purposes.
